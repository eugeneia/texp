< Abstract

 {texp} is a domain specific language embedded in _Common Lisp_ for
 printing _TeX expressions_. Because, let's face it, _TeX_ is a horrible
 programming language. I created {texp} to ease the programatic
 generation of _TeX_ documents and programs from within _Common Lisp_.
 By intertwining both languages, {texp} brings high level meta
 programming to _TeX_ and enables you to produce high quality print media
 in an easy and scalable fashion.

 If you have no experience with _TeX_ then none of what follows will make
 any sense to you. {texp} has no model of _TeX's_ semantics, besides
 escaping special characters. For an introduction to _TeX_ I recommend
 Knuth's _TeXbook_.

< A brief example

 To utilize {texp} we need to intern the {texp} package and import the
 {texp:syntax} readtable:

 #code {in-readtable} is provided by {named-readtables}.#
 (defpackage texp-example
   (:use :texp :named-readtables))

 (in-package :texp)

 (in-readtable texp:syntax)
 #

 Assume we need to generate a localized document. We could do that by
 using a function that accepts localized captions and fills in a _TeX_
 document.

 #code #
 (defun tex-menu (menu translations)
    (deftex item (caption price translation)
      ($ caption) " " ($ price)
      (br)
      ($ translation)
      (bigskip))
    (loop for (caption price) in menu
          for translation in translations
      do (tex (item {($ (escape caption))}
                    {($ (escape price))}
                    {($ (escape translation))})))
    (tex (bye)))
 #

 {deftex} enables us to use _TeX_'s {\\def} with more descriptive
 parameter names. {br} prints a double newline and {escape} handles
 escaping of _TeX_'s many special characters. _TeX_ macros can be
 expressed in a lispy way.

< The {tex} macro

 The {tex} macro translates its child expressions to _TeX_
 expressions. It is a very thin abstraction at the syntax layer. The
 translation rules are listed below:

 #table {tex} translation rules. {foo} and {bar} could be strings or
 numbers as well. In case of symbols, the {symbol-name}s are printed in
 lower case for convenience. Brackets and curly braces require the
 readtable {texp:syntax}. All expressions can be nested.#
 | s-expression    | translates to
 | {(foo bar baz)} | {\\foo barbaz}
 | {[foo bar]}     | {[foobar]}
 | {{foo bar\}}    | {{foobar\}}

 The {(br)} form prints two newlines, used to seperate paragraphs in
 _TeX_:

 #code#
 (tex (br))
 ▷ 
 ▷ 
 #

 The {$} form lets you interpolate values into {tex} bodies. Consider the
 following example:

 #code#
 (let ((x "Hello!"))
   (tex ($ x)))
 ▷ Hello!
 #

 The {escape} function can be used to escape characters treated specially
 by _TeX_ in strings of input. A table of escape rules is bound to
 {*escape-table*}.

 #code#
 (tex ($ (escape "$$$")))
 ▷ \$\$\$
 #

< The {deftex} macro

 The {deftex} macro simplifies writing _TeX_'s {\\def} statements using
 {texp}. It's best described by example:

 #code#
 (deftex foo (parameter-a parameter-b)
   (bar ($ parameter-a) ($ parameter-b)))
 ▷ \def \foo #1#2{\bar #1#2}

 (tex (foo {"hello"} {"world"}))
 ▷ \foo {hello} {world}
 #

 As you can see, {deftex} does not do much at all. Nevertheless, it
 provides a lispy syntax for _TeX_ {\\def}'s and enables you to use
 descriptive parameter names by hiding _TeX_'s natural parameter syntax
 with a {let}.
